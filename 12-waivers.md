## 12. Waivers

1. When a player is put on waivers, half of his current salary and contract is counted against a franchise's cap and contract ceiling.
1. A team can only get relief for a salary and contract after the player is assigned a new contract by any team.
1. All future contract years for players that are waived are credited to the team.
1. If a franchise waives a player and wishes to claim that player back, the player in question must clear waivers, be dropped at least 48 hours before that week's waiver deadline, and not picked up by any of the other 9 owners.
1. If the owner is successful in reclaiming their player, then the owner has the right to issue a new contract as long as it does not violate the team’s contract cap. This does not absolve the owner of the previous salary and contract obligation.
1. Players who are waived and not signed by any other team during the year will each count against the waiving owner’s salary cap and contract ceiling (see 12.1/12.3) until January 5. This 'cap hit' includes players waived during the off-season - even if the player retires or is physically unable to perform.
