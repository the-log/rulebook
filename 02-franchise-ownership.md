## 2. Franchise Ownership

1. There is no cost to own a franchise and its draft picks.
1. An owner may only own one franchise.
1. Owners can name their franchise whatever they choose.
1. If an owner chooses to leave the league, is not heard from for two consecutive weeks during the season, two weeks during the RFA signing period, or 60 days during the off season a replacement owner will be sought. The “Franchise Owner Activity” will track this on the league page. (If you will be out of town simply let the commissioner know) The Commissioner will make an attempt to locate the owner but it is the owner’s responsibility to check his team.
1. Priority will be given to replacements that current owners know.
