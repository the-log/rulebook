## 6. Rosters

1. Each franchise will maintain an in-season active roster with a maximum of 40 players. (Not including the DTS)
1. It is the ownersâ€™ decision on how many players to carry at each position.
1. If any team carries less than 40 players, $1 of Cap room and one contract year must be left unallocated for each open roster slot when contracts are assigned. After week 8 this rule is waived.
1. During the off-season (day after the League Championship till the cut-downs) there will be no roster size limitation. However, the rosters will be moved to the forums to allow for more than 40 man rosters. They will be re-entered into ESPN following the next year's Final Cut Date
1. All rookies will count against any max roster sizes until 'DTS day' -see rule 7.10.
1. The final cut down date for rosters will be one week prior to the first NFL game at 12:00 AM EST to consist of at max 40 active players, 8 DTS in first season (13 DTS players after first season), and any IR players. On final cut down day, each owner must post a message listing a) their active players, b) DTS players, and c) IR players, if any. If a team does not meet these deadlines, said team will be docked five (5) dollars of Salary cap each day until they have done so.
