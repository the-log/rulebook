## 10. Trading

1. Trades between teams are unlimited. However, if any trades appear to be one-sided or otherwise unfair, the league owners may be asked to vote whether or not to approve the transaction.
1. Any owner is free to bring any question regarding a trade to the attention of the commissioner. If the commissioner receives 3 requests by e-mail within 48 hours of the trade to put a trade up for vote, we will submit the trade to the 8 non-involved owners for a league-wide vote, absent unusual circumstances. Vote must be 1 plus 50% who vote. Thus if everyone votes, leaving 8 non involved owners, 5 votes are required to Veto if a vote is called. Obviously if only 6 people vote, then only 4 votes are needed to veto. So to be heard, every vote counts and is encouraged to be cast regardless of your opinion of the trade, if a veto is called on by the league....
1. ~~The commissioners may veto any trade without calling for a vote if itâ€™s not in the best interest of both teams or is detrimental to the league as a whole. Both Commissioners must agree the trade is not appropriate for rule 10.3 to be enforced~~
1. When a trade is made, BOTH owners must notify the commissioner to make the trade official. The trade will be approved or denied at the HHB site. Owners should have the trade in the system at HHB prior to posting a thread.

1. Any exchange of players between teams cannot leave either team with more than $1000 of salaries, 100 total contract years for all players or exceed the maximum 40 man roster.
1. If any trade violates rule 10.9, the commissioner will delay the trade until such time as the affected teams can make room under the contract/roster cap.
1. When a conditional trade is made involving Cap Room, teams must reimburse the party concerned before the start of RFA. If a team fails to have the available Cap space to cover said conditions they will be required to: 1.) Sell off players until the debt is eliminated. 2.) Offer a player(s) as compensation.
