## 7. Developmental Taxi Squad

1. Each franchise will be allocated a Developmental Taxi Squad.
1. The DTS may contain up to 13 players (8 in the initial season). NFL Players may be on your DTS for up to 3 full seasons who have never been assigned a HHB contract.
1. Contracts are not allocated to DTS players but Salaries are.
1. DTS players will be assigned a DTS salary of 10% of their draft pick salary. This DTS salary counts directly against your cap. Free agents signed to the DTS will similarly receive a DTS salary of 10% of the FA salary. DTS Salaries are the only salaries that will be allowed to be less than a dollar and will be cumulative to the tenth of a dollar but will count against the cap rounded up to the nearest dollar. (Ex: Your DTS has salaries of 0.10, 0.20, 0.10, 1.00 and 0.50. Your total DTS salary is $1.90 but will count as $2.00 against the cap). You cannot demote players to the DTS until the inaugural draft is over. This is to prevent teams from overbidding rookies in an attempt to garner more auction dollars.
1. The deadline for announcing DTS players will be one week prior to the first NFL game at 12:00 AM EST.
1. Players on the DTS are not eligible to start a game until they are moved onto the active roster.
1. Players may be moved from the DTS to the active roster after week 1 providing there is an open roster slot and a contract available. The commissioner, via the message board or email, must be notified if a DTS player is to be put onto an active roster.
1. Players that are moved from the DTS to an active roster must immediately be given a contract and are now available to be in the weekly line-up.
1. Once a player is on an active roster (beginning 1 week prior to NFL season), he may not be placed on any DTS again.
1. DTS players do not participate in RFA.
1. DTS players must be declared by the in-season roster deadline, of one week prior to the first NFL game at 12:00 AM EST. Active roster players may not be moved to the DTS after this time.
1. FA’s may be placed directly onto the DTS providing they meet all the requirements.
1. Traded players may be put onto the DTS only if they were on the other teams DTS before the trade.
1. DTS players that are accidentally submitted into a starting line-up will be removed and that team will get 0 points from that position.
1. Once a player’s 3rd season expires on your DTS, or the end of his 3rd season the owner must assign him a contract or allow him to become a FA and entered into the free agent pool. He will never be a RFA, as he never had a contract on your team.
1. 2nd or 3rd year players that have not been assigned an HHB contract may be put onto your DTS provided they meet the criteria of rule 7.16. This will only be allowed in 2008. In the 2009 season or later, only rookies may be placed onto the DTS from the FA pool.
1. Players who finish the year high enough in season long scoring may not remain on the DTS in the following year. This move must occur before DTS day. If the team does not have cap room to accommodate the move, the player must be traded or sufficient cuts must be made. Minimum requirements for the DTS by position include:
    - QB: No higher than 32nd in QB scoring
    - RB: No higher than 40th in RB scoring
    - WR: No higher than 50th in WR scoring
    - TE: No higher than 20th in TE scoring
    - PK: No higher than 32nd in PK scoring
    - DL: No higher than 40th in DL scoring
    - LB: No higher than 50th in LB scoring
    - DB: No higher than 50th in DB scoring
1. Players are limited to a maximum 4 year contract when being signed from the DTS.
