## 3. Initial Draft, Contracts and Salary Cap

1. Each team is forced to comply with a hard salary cap of $1000 and a contract cap of 100 years. Failure to comply with either cap will result in a written warning with the first offense, minor cap penalties with the second offense, major cap penalties with the third offense and finally, league expulsion.
1. The initial distribution of players will be an auction style. The winning auction price will be the salary of the player bided upon. Contracts will be assigned at a later date.
1. Each owner need not fill to the league maximum of 40 players but must at least acquire at least 32 players via the initial player auction.
1. Initially, each owner will submit three players to be bid upon in the auction opening.
1. Auctions will remain open for a player until the high bid does not change for 1 minute in the live draft and 24 hours online (online auctions automatically close 48 hours after opening to ensure the draft moves forward). Proxy bidding will be available to speed up this process. All owners are encouraged to bid the maximum they are willing to pay for that player in one proxy bid to facilitate quick auction closings. Bid increments are per dollar.
1. When an auction closes, the player will be awarded to the winning franchise with his salary equal to the winning bid. Furthermore, the winning owner will now submit two more players for auction. This process will continue until all teams have finished bidding or exhausted cap room.
1. Rookies in the inaugural year of the league will be available for auction from the greater free agent pool. In subsequent years, rookies will be distributed by a rookie draft. All rookies NOT taken in the rookie draft will be considered free agents.
1. Owners may not bid such that they will not have enough to fill their roster to 40 players. It would be wise for owners to be wary that rookie contracts (even DTS) as well as free agents cost cap room.
1. Trading that results in a roster in violation of either cap will be suspended until the offending roster can be in compliance or the trade is reworked.
1. If an owner making a draft pick does not have the cap room to accommodate the oncoming rookie, the rookie pick will stand but the owner will be forced make cap room for the rookie or cut the rookie before the Final Cut Date.
